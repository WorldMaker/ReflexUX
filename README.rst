========

ReflexUX is an attempt to port many of the useful dynamic tools from
`ImpromptuInterface.MVVM`_ on top of ReactiveUI_. The goal of this
"impromptu reaction" library is to remove what remains of "MVVM
boilerplate". If it does what it is meant to, it should make building
responsive user experiences simple and easy, like almost a *reflex*.
